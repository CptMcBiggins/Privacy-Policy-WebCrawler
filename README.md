Privacy Policy WebCrawler

Python script that crawls and scrapes privacy policy for information.

The script scapes <p>, <li>, <td>, <span>, and <a> tags with associated key words from the specified URL and puts them into a list.
  That list gets cleaned and checked for duplicate strings and then sent to google sheets in the corresponding column.
